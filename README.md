This song is often refered in Computer Science courses.  
I'll quote WikiPedia here:

> The computer scientist Donald Knuth proved that the song has a complexity of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;O(logN)" /> in his in-joke-article ["The Complexity of Songs"](http://www.cs.bme.hu/~friedl/alg/knuth_song_complexity.pdf).

> Numerous computer programs exist to output the lyrics to the song. This is analogous to "Hello, World!" programs, with the addition of a loop. As with "Hello World!", this can be a practice exercise for those studying computer programming, and a demonstration of different programming paradigms dealing with looping constructs and syntactic differences between programming languages within a paradigm.
