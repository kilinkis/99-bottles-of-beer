<h1 style="text-align: center;">üçªüçªüçª Lyrics for "99 Bottles of Beer" üçªüçªüçª</h1>

This little javascript will render the lyrics for the famous folk song ["99 Bottles of Beer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer) right in your console!  
This song is often refered in Computer Science courses.  
I'll quote WikiPedia here:

> The computer scientist Donald Knuth proved that the song has a complexity of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;O(logN)" /> in his in-joke-article ["The Complexity of Songs"](http://www.cs.bme.hu/~friedl/alg/knuth_song_complexity.pdf).

> Numerous computer programs exist to output the lyrics to the song. This is analogous to "Hello, World!" programs, with the addition of a loop. As with "Hello World!", this can be a practice exercise for those studying computer programming, and a demonstration of different programming paradigms dealing with looping constructs and syntactic differences between programming languages within a paradigm.

## Bonus track (pun intended):

### 99 bottles by Zane Williams

A funnier and less verbose version of the original song. Also, probably the best song ever written:

#### How do I run this??

Just paste the code in your browser's terminal, or, if you're feeling lazy, just click [here](https://jsbin.com/xemovewaca/edit?js,console), but the fancy colors don't work on JSBIN.
